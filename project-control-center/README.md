## Project Control Center

Project Control Center (PCC) is a platform that allows project administrators to set up the projects when they get associated with The Linux Foundation. You can set up the projects to use various services that are provided by The Linux Foundation.

PCC assists you in onboarding an open source project with great ease. Project Control Center helps you get started quickly by providing all the support that you need with self-service configuration for governance, membership, IT, developer and collaboration tools, documentation, and community roles. You can read more about PCC by visiting our [website](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/project-control-center).
