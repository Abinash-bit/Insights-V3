# Commits

A commit refers to a specific change or set of changes made to the source code of a project. It represents a set of modifications or additions to the source code, documentation, or other project-related files. When contributors change the project, they typically create one or more commits to document those changes. A commit typically includes the following information:

**Modified files:** the files that have been changed or added in the commit.

**Code changes:** the specific lines of code that have been modified or added, typically represented as a diff or patch.

**Commit message:** a brief description or summary of the changes made in the commit. These messages provide context to contributors and future developers reviewing the commit history.
