# Commits

The **Commits** metric refers to the quantification and analysis of code commits made by contributors within a specified timeframe. A code commit represents a unit of change to the software's source code repository.&#x20;

Each commit includes the following:

* Commits Authored: These are the number of commits where the author of the commit is the selected user. The number is a hyperlink, and on click, it opens a modal that shows the LOC ++ (added) and LOC -- (deleted).
* Commits Co-Authored: These are the number of commits where the user has been a co-author.

### Why is this metric important?

The Commits Metric provides insights into the volume and frequency of code changes made by contributors. By visualizing commit data in a bar chart, project maintainers and stakeholders can evaluate the level of activity and track the progress of development efforts over time.
