# Best Practice Score

A best practice score visualization is a tool that helps project leads and managers assess the overall health and quality of an open source software project.&#x20;

It typically evaluates the project against a set of best practices or standards for software development, such as under the categories **`Documentation`**`,`` `**`License`**`,`` `**`Best Practices`**`,`` `**`Security`**` ``and`` `**`Legal`.** It generates a score or rating based on how well the project meets these criteria.
